  <h1>Create a sales commission</h1>

<!-- # End user configuration

In this section, we will walk through the step-by-step process of creating an end user within the nGenue application. After you are done creating an end user, you will need to add their [address](create_end_user.md#create-an-end-user-address), set up a [sales contract](create_end_user.md#create-a-sales-contract) and [price agreement](./create_end_user.md#add-price-agreement), and add facilities to activate the account. Each of these steps is detailed in separate topics on this page.
<br><br>

> In this article, you'll be able to understand:<br>
    1. [How to create an end user](create_end_user.md#create-an-end-user)<br>
    2. [How to add address of an end user](create_end_user.md#create-an-end-user-address)<br>
    3. [How to add sales contract for an end user](create_end_user.md#create-an-end-user-sales-contract)<br>

1.  In the **End user configuration** screen, click on the **Add an end user record** button. 
    ![add_user_record](images/end_user_4.png)
2. The table below provides detailed explanations for each field in the available in the **End user configuration** screen:

    ![end_user_configure](images/end_user_5.png)

3. The **End user configuration** screen is also divided into multiple tabs, each designed to capture specific details required for end user configuration. 

    Below is a detailed explanation of each tab:

    ### 1. General tab

    *LDC information*

    | Field name | Description |
    |------------|------------|
    | LDC | The local distribution company responsible for delivering gas to the end user. |
    | Current rate/rider | The current rate plan or rider assigned to the end user. |
    | Default pool account | The default pool account linked to the end user’s gas supply. |
    | Previous rate/rider prior to | Displays the previous rate plan or rider that was assigned before the current one. |
    | LDC rep | The representative from the LDC assigned to manage the end user's account. |

    *Retail billing method and description*

    | Field name | Description |
    |------------|------------|
    | Billing method name | Specifies the billing method used for the end user, determining how invoices are generated and sent. The available options are: <br> **Rate Ready** – The supplier sets a predefined rate, and the LDC calculates the bill based on usage. This method ensures consistency but requires accurate rate setup in advance. <br> **Bill Ready** – The supplier provides the entire bill calculation, and the LDC only delivers the invoice to the customer. This offers more control over billing but requires additional data management by the supplier. <br> **Dual Bill** – The supplier and the LDC generate separate invoices for their respective charges. This is used when both entities need to bill the customer directly. <br> **Single Bill** – A consolidated bill where the supplier and LDC charges are combined into a single invoice, simplifying the payment process for the end user. |
    | Broker fee reminder | Indicates whether a broker fee reminder is set for this account. |
    | Campaign ID | Identifies if the end user is part of a specific marketing or pricing campaign. |
    | Parent customer comments | Additional notes related to the parent customer, if applicable. |

    *End user management*

    | Field name | Description |
    |------------|------------|
    | Status | Displays the current management status of the end user, which affects their ability to receive gas supply and billing. The options include: <br> **Prospect** – The end user is in the initial setup phase and has not yet been activated for service. <br> **Setup/Pending** – The account setup is in progress, but certain steps (such as contract approval or LDC confirmation) are still required. <br> **Active** – The end user is fully enrolled, and service is currently being provided. They will be billed according to their selected billing method. <br> **Credit Hold** – The account is temporarily suspended due to credit issues, preventing further gas supply or transactions. This status requires resolution of outstanding balances or credit approval. <br> **Terminated** – The end user's service has been permanently discontinued. No further transactions or billing will occur. |
    | Contract status | Indicates the progress of the end user’s contract in the enrollment process. The status impacts service activation and billing. The options are: <br> **Awaiting LDC Confirmation** – The supplier has submitted the enrollment request, and the LDC must confirm the activation before service begins. <br> **Awaiting Credit Approval** – The contract is pending credit evaluation. If the end user does not meet credit requirements, additional guarantees or deposits may be needed. <br> **Awaiting Enrollment Complete** – The contract has been processed, but final enrollment steps (such as validation of meter setup or additional documentation) are still pending. <br> **Enrollment Complete** – The contract is fully executed, and the end user is officially enrolled in the system, allowing gas supply and billing to begin. |
    | Default metering interval | Defines the frequency at which the end user’s meter readings are recorded, which impacts how often billing and consumption tracking occur. The available options are: <br> **Daily** – Meter readings are taken every day, providing the most detailed consumption data. This is useful for high-usage customers who require precise tracking. <br> **Calendar Monthly** – Readings are recorded once per calendar month, typically on a fixed date. This standard approach aligns with most billing cycles. <br> **Cycle Monthly** – Meter readings follow a specific billing cycle rather than the calendar month, which may vary based on LDC-defined schedules. <br> **Bill Cycle; Manage Daily** – Allows for daily meter readings, but the billing cycle follows a predefined schedule. This provides detailed usage tracking while maintaining structured billing periods. |
    | Active fac | Shows the number of active facilities linked to the end user. |
    | # Facilities | Displays the total number of facilities associated with the end user. |
    | Default storage target | Specifies the default storage target assigned to the end user. |
    | Storage target override | Enables the user to override the default storage target if necessary. |
    | Enable daily pricing | Indicates whether daily pricing is enabled for the end user’s account. |

    | Round volumes to | Specifies the rounding method for gas volume calculations. Options may include **No Rounding, Round to Whole Number, Round to Nearest 0.1, or Round to Nearest 0.01**. Rounding helps maintain consistency and avoids minor discrepancies in billing calculations. |
