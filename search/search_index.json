For example, if the current delivery month is set to August 2025, all billing items generated will relate to that month\u2019s consumption and pricing terms. LDC (required) Refers to the LDC for which billing is being prepared. Since different LDCs may have unique billing structures, selecting the correct LDC ensures that the right pricing, riders, and charges are applied to the end users under that service territory. Pool A pool is a grouping of end users under a particular LDC. Pools often represent a specific service area, load group, or delivery arrangement. Selecting the right pool ensures that the system applies charges correctly to the intended customer group. Rate/rider Determines which pricing structure or rider should be applied to the billing. A rider may include special surcharges, discounts, or additional fees. This field ensures that customer contracts tied to specific rates are billed according to their agreed terms. End users (active only) Specifies the active end users to include in billing. Only customers with active contracts for the chosen delivery month will be billed. Legal entity Represents the registered company that owns the billing relationship. This allows billing to be tied to a specific legal entity in multi-entity organizations. Marketer Identifies the marketer or supplier responsible for the gas supply. This field allows billing runs to be filtered by marketer, if applicable. Read end dates through Sets an end date for including meter reads or usage records. Only reads with dates on or before the selected value are considered.

In this case, Physical NG (Natural Gas) is selected as it involves the physical delivery of natural gas. Selecting the correct instrument ensures the deal is processed under the appropriate market rules and contract terms. Buy/sell Specifies whether the deal is a buy (purchase of gas) or a sell (sale of gas). This is crucial for financial accounting and tracking gas flow. It also determines whether the company is acquiring gas from a supplier or selling it to an end user. Start date and end date Defines the duration of the deal. The start date indicates when the deal becomes active, and the end date marks its expiration. Setting the correct date range ensures that contractual obligations, pricing periods, and gas deliveries align correctly. Initial volume Specifies the total amount of natural gas committed under this deal. The volume is important for scheduling deliveries, ensuring compliance with contract terms, and forecasting supply needs. Underestimating or overestimating this value can impact financial and operational planning. Volume period Determines whether the initial volume is distributed on a daily or monthly basis. This selection affects billing calculations, scheduling logistics, and contract fulfilment. Daily volumes are used in short-term contracts, while monthly volumes are common in long-term agreements. Pricing period Specifies whether the price for the volume is set on a daily or monthly basis. This aligns with the pricing model agreed upon with the counterparty. Daily pricing is typically used for volatile markets, whereas monthly pricing provides stability. Description A brief summary or identifier for the deal. Helps users quickly understand the nature, purpose, or special conditions of the deal. Typically includes relevant details like deal type, counterparty, or special pricing conditions. Trade date The date when the deal was executed. Important for historical tracking, regulatory reporting, and risk assessment. Trade dates impact financial reporting, as well as compliance with market regulations. Trader The person or entity responsible for executing the deal. Ensures accountability and allows for tracking individual traders\u2019 activity for audit and risk management purposes. Unit of measure Defines how the gas volume is measured (e.g., MMBtu, Therms, Dekatherms). Ensures accurate calculations for billing, transportation, and reporting. Different pipelines or markets may require specific units. Btu rate The heat content conversion factor for natural gas. Used to standardize gas pricing and volume conversions across different suppliers, pipelines, and contracts. Ensures accurate valuation of gas energy content. Supply region Identifies the geographical region from which the gas is sourced. This field is necessary for logistics, regulatory compliance, and pricing calculations, as gas costs vary by location due to transportation fees and supply availability. Pricing type Specifies whether pricing is deal-based or location-based: 1. Deal-Based Pricing: The price is set at the deal level, meaning the cost remains fixed for that particular deal regardless of location. 2. Location-Based Pricing: The price is determined by the pipeline location or market hub. This allows for variable pricing based on regional price fluctuations, market demand, or LDC rules. Deal source Specifies how the deal was created (e.g., manually entered, imported from an external system, or generated via an API). Helps in data validation and troubleshooting by tracking deal origins.

The complexity of retail gas operations stems from factors such as variable pricing models, seasonal demand fluctuations, pipeline transportation costs, and regulatory compliance requirements.
