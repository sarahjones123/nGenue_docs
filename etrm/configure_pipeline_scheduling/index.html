<p>The following article provides step-by-step instructions to assist users in efficiently scheduling gas nominations, handling transportation agreements, and monitoring gas flow across pipelines. The aim is to support accurate planning, seamless scheduling, and streamlined operations within the pipeline management process.</p>

<h4 id="nomination-settings">Nomination settings<a class="headerlink" href="#nomination-settings" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>The <strong>Nomination settings</strong> serves as the initial step in the pipeline scheduling process. Here, you can apply specific filters to refine data and narrow down the pipelines available for scheduling. This focused selection of records ensures efficiency in locating the precise pipeline and nomination details required for scheduling gas transfers.</p>
<p>Also, you can create a nomination by specifying essential details such as the start and end dates, transport agreements, and pipeline nominations. This section is critical for ensuring that all nominations align with contractual requirements and desired gas flow paths.</p>

<p>The table below describes the available fields and their functions:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Fields</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><a href="../../getting_started/configure_pipeline/">Pipeline</a></td>
<td>This filter uses a dropdown list populated with all configured pipelines, which must be selected to schedule the gas transfer. If no pipelines have been created in the system, this dropdown will remain empty, underscoring the need for prior pipeline configuration.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>External legal entity</td>
<td>This dropdown filter lists all external legal entities available in the system, pulling data from the <strong>External legal entity</strong> screen. Only entities configured in that screen will appear here. Selecting an external legal entity helps identify the counterparty involved in the transfer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="../../getting_started/configure_book_structure/#step-2-create-a-new-legal-entity">Internal legal entity</a></td>
<td>This dropdown filter lists internal legal entities configured in the <strong>Book structure</strong> screen, enabling users to designate the internal entity responsible for the deal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>External business unit</td>
<td>This dropdown allows users to select from business units defined as external, drawing data from the <strong>External business unit</strong> screen. This filter provides further specificity regarding the counterparty’s business structure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="../../getting_started/configure_book_structure/#step-3-add-a-business-unit-to-the-legal-entity">Internal business unit</a></td>
<td>Similar to the <strong>External business unit,</strong> the internal business unit dropdown is populated with data from the <strong>Book structure</strong> screen. Selecting an internal business unit enables the user to specify the internal business unit involved in the scheduling transaction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="../../getting_started/configure_pipeline/">Market area</a></td>
<td>This dropdown lists market areas available in the system and draws data from the <strong>Master data</strong> tab on the <strong>PZL</strong> screen. Selecting a market area narrows down the records to the designated area. This data only appears if the market areas have been configured in the <strong>Master data</strong> tab.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="../../getting_started/configure_pipeline/">Operating area</a></td>
<td>The <strong>Operating area</strong> dropdown, also sourced from the <strong>Master data</strong> tab in the <strong>PZL</strong> screen, allows users to refine their scheduling to a particular operational zone. This filter becomes essential when coordinating specific regional schedules and routes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="../../getting_started/configure_pipeline/#step-3-create-a-new-pipeline-zone">Zone</a></td>
<td>The <strong>Zone</strong> dropdown allows users to select specific zones for scheduling, pulling data from the <strong>Zones and Locations</strong> tab on the <strong>PZL</strong> screen. Only configured zones will appear in this dropdown, further refining the results by geographical division.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="../../deal_management/create_deal/">Scheduling date</a></td>
<td>The <strong>Scheduling date</strong> filter is a date picker dropdown where users select the intended date for gas scheduling. The chosen date must align with the deal’s active period, falling within the start and end dates specified in the <strong>Deal management</strong> screen. If the selected date lies outside the active range of the deal, the data will not populate, as this is a required criterion for scheduling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="./#create-a-nomination">Load records</a></td>
<td>This action button displays the data matching in the <strong>Nomination creation and management</strong> section based on the chosen filter criteria, ensuring that only the relevant pipeline and nomination information appears.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>There are additional fields that is primarily used when you create a new nominations. These fields are explained under <a href="#create-a-nomination">create a nomination</a> section.</p>
<h4 id="nomination-creation-and-management">Nomination creation and management<a class="headerlink" href="#nomination-creation-and-management" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>In the <strong>Nomination creation and management</strong> section, after selecting the filters and loading the records, deal records for the specified scheduling date and pipeline will populate based on the deal type. These deal records appear in either the <strong>Buys</strong> or <strong>Sells</strong> sections, depending on whether it is a buy or a sell deal.
<a class="glightbox" data-type="image" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" href="../images/pipeline_scheduling_4.png" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="nomination_creation_screen" src="../images/pipeline_scheduling_4.png"></a></p>
<p>The initial volume specified while configuring a deal is displayed as the <strong>Planned volume</strong> in this scheduling screen. From here, the nomination process begins, requiring you to define where and how the gas should be scheduled, through which pipeline it will travel, and its end destination.</p>
<p>The nomination requires selecting start and end points for gas transfer. If any interconnects are available, they may be chosen as endpoints, depending on the selected pipeline. The next step involves entering nomination volumes for both the start and end points in the <strong>New Nom</strong> column, which initiates the scheduling process. </p>
<p>Each of the six sections in this module— <strong>Buys</strong>, <strong>Sells</strong>, <strong>Receipt Interconnects, Delivery Interconnects, Receipt Pool and Storage,</strong> and <strong>Delivery Pool and Storage</strong> plays a role in defining, scheduling, and tracking the volume. Below is a breakdown of each section and column.</p>
<h5 id="buys">Buys<a class="headerlink" href="#buys" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h5>
<p>The <strong>Buys</strong> section is critical for managing gas purchase transactions within the pipeline system. It provides a detailed view of each buy deal, including scheduled volumes, nomination details, and key identifiers. 
<a class="glightbox" data-type="image" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" href="../images/pipeline_scheduling_5.png" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="buys_deal" src="../images/pipeline_scheduling_5.png"></a></p>
