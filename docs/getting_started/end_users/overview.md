## How are access levels and security settings managed for end users?

Each of nGenueâ€™s software modules is designed for the enforcement of standard security protocols, adhering to several layers of security.

- nGenue recommends a windows-based authentication model for user access to all data. This places access to data directly under the authority of client network administrators. nGenue recommends a network role be set up for all nGenue application users. Within that role, access can be granted as needed at various levels (Read only, Admin, Reporting, etc.).
- Within nGenue, those with the administrator role can create any number of operational user groups that will be using nGenue. Every user interface screen within nGenue is then granted or denied access based on the role to which a user belongs. 
- Within specific user interface screen layouts, certain actions are further restricted based on the permissions granted.
- At the most granular level, the nGenue database allows the use of row level security (RLS) whereby certain users are restricted at the row level based on whether they are part of a given group. 

For example, if Jane Smith works in New Jersey and is not allowed to see information related to Pennsylvania, she can be restricted at the row level (as part of the database architecture) to see only information that is related to New Jersey. Though she has access to an *end user volume* screen, the database would only return data related to New Jersey.
