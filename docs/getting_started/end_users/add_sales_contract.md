# Add sales contract for an end user

This section outlines the steps to create a sales contract within the application.  

1. In the **End user configuration** screen, select the user for whom you want to create a contract.  
2. Click the **Sales contract** icon in the top header. This opens the **Master sales contract** screen.  
3. Fill in the required details in the **Master sales contract** screen as described in the table below. These fields capture the contract's terms and conditions, ensuring all essential details related to execution, renewal, and guarantees are accurately recorded.  

    | Field name | Description |
    |------------|------------|
    | Contract type | Specifies the type of contract being created (e.g., fixed, variable, hybrid). Required for categorizing agreements based on business needs. Useful for identifying applicable terms and compliance requirements. |
    | Effective date | Defines the date when the contract becomes active. Required for tracking contract validity. Useful for financial planning, service activation, and legal enforcement. |
    | Termination date | Specifies when the contract ends. Required for scheduling renewals or terminations. Useful for contract lifecycle management, ensuring no service disruptions, and avoiding penalties. |
    | Initial term (months) | Indicates the initial duration of the contract in months. Required for defining contract length. Useful for determining billing cycles, renewal terms, and financial forecasting. |
    | Automatic renewal (months) | Specifies whether the contract renews automatically after the initial term. Required to manage contract continuity. Useful for customer retention, avoiding service gaps, and simplifying contract extensions. |
    | Reminder (days prior) | Allows setting a reminder before contract expiration. Required to notify relevant parties about upcoming renewals or terminations. Useful for contract negotiations, renewal discussions, and legal compliance. |
    | Guaranteed saving | Indicates if the contract includes a savings guarantee. Required for customer assurance. Useful for marketing contracts, financial guarantees, and compliance with regulatory savings claims. |
    | Penalty guarantee | Specifies if a penalty applies for early contract termination. Required for enforcing contractual obligations. Useful for ensuring adherence to agreed terms and reducing early termination risks. |
    | Contract # | Stores a unique identifier for the contract. Required for tracking and referencing specific agreements. Useful for contract retrieval, audit purposes, and legal documentation. |
    | First flow date | Specifies the date when contract-based services or product deliveries begin. Required to define the start of service obligations. Useful for scheduling, operational planning, and ensuring timely execution. |
    | Date | Captures the date when the contract was signed. Required for legal validity. Useful for establishing the start of contractual obligations and verifying agreement authenticity. |
    | Signer | Specifies the name of the person who signed the contract. Required for accountability and legal enforcement. Useful for contract verification, dispute resolution, and audit trails. |


4. In the **Custom language** tab of the **Master sales contract** screen, you can modify the standard contract language, specifically for price confirmation and other clauses. It provides flexibility to tailor the contract wording based on business or regulatory requirements.

5. Next, the **Contract documents** tab, stores all related documents associated with the contract, such as signed agreements, terms and conditions, and any legal attachments. It serves as a centralized repository for contract documentation.

Click **Save** to save the configuration and close the **Sales contract** screen.
