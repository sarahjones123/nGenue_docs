# Supply region

A **Supply region** defines the geographic areas where natural gas is sourced, such as basins or fields. Configuring supply regions allows companies to map operational boundaries and manage supplier relationships effectively. This segmentation ensures better planning and optimized sourcing strategies.

For example, **ABC** can be a supply region, housing multiple supply points such as **X** and **Y.** This configuration helps aggregate volumes and pricing data for all resources from the region.
