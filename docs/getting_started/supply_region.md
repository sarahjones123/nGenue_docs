# Supply region

The Supply Region refers to the geographic areas where natural gas is extracted, processed, and made available for transportation to consumers. It encompasses all upstream and midstream activities involved in sourcing and delivering natural gas. The characteristics of a supply region can include the cost, availability, and efficiency of the natural gas supply.

!!!note "Example"
    For example, **ABC** can be a supply region, housing multiple supply points such as **X** and **Y.** This configuration helps aggregate volumes and pricing data for all resources from the region.

Configuring a supply region in the application impacts multiple screens, where users see a dropdown menu displaying the configured supply regions. This allows users to select a specific supply region from the dropdown. 

In some cases, a supply region is required.  Therefore, a minimum of one supply region should exist.
