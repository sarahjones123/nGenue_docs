# Configure a supply region

Configuring a supply region in nGenue impacts multiple screens. Users see a dropdown menu displaying the configured supply regions, which allows them to select a specific region from the dropdown.

In some cases, like creating deal or configuring a new pipeline, a supply region is required. Therefore, at least one supply region should exist.

The configuration process for the supply region captures key information about the defined supply region when used for accounting, reporting, or **Weighted Average Cost of Gas (WACOG)** purposes.

## Prerequisites

To configure a supply region in ngenue, ensure the following:

1. **Required: user permission** <br>
     You must have the appropriate user role or permission that allows you to add or modify entries on the **Supply region** screen.
2. **Optional: link to a business unit** <br>
     If you want to link the supply region to a business unit, make sure the business unit is already created from the **Internal book structure** screen. You can proceed without linking a business unit immediately and choose to link one later when needed.
3. **Optional: link to a WACOG pool** <br>
     You can link a WACOG pool to the supply region for weighted average cost calculations. To do this, create a new WACOG pool from the **Supply WACOG pool configuration** screen.

<!-- **Prerequisites:**
Before setting up the **Supply region**, you must pre-configure the following screens:

- Internal Book Structure
- Supply WACOG Pool Configuration
- Chart of Accounts List

Make sure these are properly configured before proceeding with the Supply Region setup. -->

        | ![alt text](./images/icons/edit_record_icon.png)    | Edit the supply region record detail. |
        | ![alt text](./images/icons/save_icon.png)        |  Save the supply region record. |
        | ![alt text](./images/icons/edit_current_icon.png)  | Cancel the updates being made to the supply region record. |
        | ![alt text](./images/icons/delete_icon.png)  | Delete a supply region record. |

### Step 2: Create a new supply region

1. In the **Supply region configurations** screen, click the **Add a supply region record** button.

    | Fields | Description | Data type | Mandatory (Y/N) | Fetched from (UI screen) | Displayed on (UI screen)|
    | --- | --- |--- | --- |--- | --- |
    | Supply region Id | This field is auto-generated by the system and is created automatically when a new configuration is made | Auto-generated | Y | Auto-generated | N/A |
    | Code | A unique identifier that you can use for your supply region name. <br> For example: If the supply name name is **"ABC supply region,"** the code could be **"ABSR."** | Integer | Y | User input | Pipeline location |
    | Supply region name | Enter the name of the supply region that you wish to add during the configuration process. | Integer | Y | User input | Pipeline, Pipeline location, Deal creation and Deal management screen |
    | [Business unit](./configure_book_structure.md#step-3-add-a-business-unit-to-the-legal-entity) | Select the business unit that you want to link to your supply region. | Dropdown | N | Internal book structure screen | N/A |
    | Supply WACOG pool | Link a WACOG pool to the supply region for calculation. <br> If a supply region sources gas from multiple contracts, the WACOG pool calculates a blended rate, which becomes the reference for billing or further cost management. | Dropdown | N | Supply Wacog pool configuration screen | N/A |
    | GL Expense Account | Link the supply region’s operational expenses (e.g., transportation, storage) to the correct General Ledger (GL) account. | Dropdown | N | Chart of Accounts list screen | N/A |
    | GL A/P account and GL A/R account | Select the required account details for **GL A/P account** and **GL A/R account** respectively.
