3. Once a prospect is converted to an end user and their status is updated to **Converted to end user**, they can follow the standard process to create a new quote whether for a renewal or a new purchase. 
4. After the new quote is accepted, right-click on the quote and select **Push quote renewal to price agreement** to generate the price agreement for the renewal.
