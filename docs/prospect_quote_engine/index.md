# Understanding Prospect Quote Engine (PQE)

In nGenue, the prospect journey begins when a new or existing customer explores natural gas pricing options. A key component of this process is the **Local Distribution Company (LDC) pricing product** a structured pricing plan offered by the LDC that defines how customers are charged for natural gas.
When a prospect submits a request or is onboarded in nGenue, the system leverages the **LDC pricing product** screen to transparently display the LDC’s configured rates, fees, and tariff structures. This ensures prospects understand the breakdown of costs before accepting a quote.
Once a prospect (or renewing end user) accepts a quote in the Prospect quote engine, nGenue converts them into an active customers/renewal customer(s). 

The system:

* Updates their status to **active end user** (or renews existing agreements)
* Generates a **price agreement** using Weighted Average Cost of Gas (WACOG) calculations, incorporating the **LDC pricing product’s** rates and terms
* Links associated facilities for seamless service, billing, tracking & enrollments.

A **pricing product** in nGenue serves as a predefined framework for natural gas cost calculations, ensuring consistency and compliance with LDC tariffs. By integrating LDC pricing early in the prospect workflow, nGenue streamlines approvals, reduces confusion, and accelerates contract execution.
