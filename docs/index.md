When we evaluated nGenue, we were impressed with it being a system designed specifically for Natural Gas. Now that we are operating our business with nGenue, we’ve found nGenue does everything they said it would do and more. It has been the smoothest transition and the most successful project I have ever experienced. We implemented the new nGenue ETRM system for our Natural Gas business in under 6 months – extraordinary compared with what we’ve heard is the industry norm!
