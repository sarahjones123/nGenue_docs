# Physical deal overview

A physical deal involves the actual delivery of natural gas from one party to another, often including specific terms for volume, location, and timing. These transactions typically occur between producers, marketers, and end-users, and they require coordination of storage and transportation logistics to ensure fulfillment. Physical deals are foundational to the natural gas market as they ensure the movement of energy resources from supply points to areas of demand.
