# Future deal

A future deal in the natural gas market involves an agreement to buy or sell a specified volume of natural gas at a predetermined price on a future date. These deals are typically traded on exchanges and are used as a hedging tool to manage price volatility. Future deals do not necessarily result in physical delivery, as they can be settled financially based on the market price at expiration.
