# Navigate to the LDC configuration screen

You will be able to access LDC configuration page by typing *LDC configuration* in the quick search available in the nGenue application homepage. Select **LDC configuration** and this will redirect you to the **LDC configuration** screen.

## Available navigational links

The **LDC configuration** screen includes a set of icons located in the top-header menu, each acting as a navigational link to related screens within the nGenue application. These links are designed to streamline access to interconnected configuration modules, allowing users to seamlessly manage all aspects of an LDC without navigating away from the current screen.

For example, users can quickly access the **LDC representative** screen to review or update contact details and roles of representatives responsible for that LDC. The **LDC meter type** screen allows users to view and configure the types of meters used by the LDC for tracking gas usage. Similarly, the **daily factor definition** screen and **daily storage definition** screen help in setting calculation factors and storage options that impact allocations and supply planning.

By centralizing all these links on a single screen, the application enhances user productivity and ensures consistent and efficient LDC configuration management across multiple business functions.
