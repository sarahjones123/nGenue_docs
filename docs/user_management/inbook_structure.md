# Legal Entity, Business Unit, Strategy, and Portfolio

The **Legal Entity, Business Unit, Strategy,** and **Portfolio** form the foundational building blocks of the organizational hierarchy for a trader. These elements help segment operational, financial, and strategic activities across different divisions. Proper configuration ensures compliance, accountability, and alignment with corporate goals.

* **Legal Entity:** The primary company entity engaging in contracts and transactions.
* **Business Unit:** Sub-entities within the legal entity, managing specific operations (e.g., retail gas, industrial supply).
* **Strategy:** Defines goals like securing supply, managing costs, or maximizing revenue.
* **Portfolio:** Groups contracts, deals, and assets under a strategy to facilitate reporting and analytics.

!!! note "Example"

    For a natural gas company, the Legal Entity might be "EnergyCorp LLC," with Business Units like "Wholesale Operations" and "Retail Services." A Strategy could involve maximizing sales to industrial clients, while the Portfolio includes contracts and pipelines supporting that goal.
