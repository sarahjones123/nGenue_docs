# ETRM overview

**ETRM** stands for *Energy, Trade, and Risk Management.*

ETRM in nGenue focuses on managing the full lifecycle of wholesale natural gas transactions. It integrates trading, transportation, risk management, and reporting capabilities into a unified platform, tailored to the unique requirements of wholesale operations.

**Key wholesale processes supported by nGenue's ETRM include**:

* **Trading**: Facilitates the buying and selling of natural gas in wholesale markets.
* **Contract Management**: Manages long-term and short-term contracts with suppliers, buyers, and transporters.
* **Transportation Logistics**: Optimizes pipeline scheduling, nominations, and storage.
* **Risk Assessment**: Monitors price volatility, credit exposure, and operational risks.
* **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensures adherence to industry standards and legal requirements.

### Workflow explanation

Here is the detailed workflow sequence for the ETRM process, reflecting the flow described in the the above PlantUML diagram.

1. **Create a deal**

    1. The process begins when the trader initiates [**creating a deal**](../deal_management/physical_deal.md).
    2. The system verifies whether all prerequisite configurations are completed.

2. **Check configurations**<br>
If configurations are incomplete, the trader must complete them:
    {% include-markdown "../variable/etrm_prerequisities.md" %}
    <br>

    Once configurations are complete, the system allows proceeding to deal type selection.

3. **Select deal type**

    1. Based on the trader's choice, the system creates either:
        1. **Buy Deal**: Represents the purchase of natural gas.
        1. **Sell Deal**: Represents the sale of natural gas.

4. **Create transport contract**

    1. After selecting the deal type, the trader creates a [**Transport contract**.](../user_management/transport_contract.md)
    2. The contract outlines the terms and conditions for transporting natural gas.

5. **Proceed to nominations**<br>
The system moves to the [**Nominations**](../etrm/nominations.md) phase to schedule the movement of natural gas.

6. **Select nomination type**

    1. Traders select from various nomination types:
        1. **Buy Nominations**: Requests for purchased natural gas being transported or stored.
        2. **Sell Nominations**: Requests for sold natural gas being transported to buyers.
        3. **Interconnects**: Specify gas flow between different pipeline systems or facilities.
        4. **Pool and storage nominations**: Include injection into or withdrawal from storage facilities or pooling points.

7. **Create and finalize nomination**
    1. The system processes the selected nominations, allowing for adjustments if necessary.
    2. Once all required nominations are complete, the system finalizes them.

8. **Perform [settlement process](../etrm/settlements.md)**<br>
The system reconciles financial and operational data as part of the settlement process.

9. **Print [settlement report](../etrm/settlements.md)**<br>
The workflow concludes with the trader printing a settlement report for record-keeping and compliance.
