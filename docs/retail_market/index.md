# Understanding retail gas business in nGenue

The retail natural gas business is a critical segment of the energy industry, involving the distribution and sale of natural gas to commercial, industrial, and residential end users. Unlike the wholesale market, where large volumes of gas are traded among producers, marketers, and utilities, the retail market focuses on delivering gas to customers in smaller, metered quantities. Managing the retail side of the business requires coordination between various stakeholders, including **Local Distribution Company (LDC), marketers, and end users.**

nGenue enables retail gas suppliers to manage their operations seamlessly. It provides built in features that allows handle **LDC management, rate class definitions, charge structures, price agreements, meter readings,** and **billing.** By automating these processes, nGenue ensures that suppliers can accurately track gas consumption, apply appropriate pricing, and generate invoices for customers. The platform is designed to accommodate complex market structures and regulatory requirements, allowing businesses to streamline operations and improve efficiency.

## Overview of retail natural gas market

The retail natural gas market functions as the last stage of the natural gas supply chain, where natural gas is delivered to commercial, industrial, and residential customers through LDCs. Unlike the wholesale market, which involves bulk trading of natural gas between producers and suppliers, the retail market caters to individual customers with specific pricing structures, contract terms, and billing cycles.

One of the defining features of the retail gas market is its regulatory framework. In some regions, the market is deregulated, allowing customers to choose their gas supplier independently of the LDC. In regulated markets, LDCs maintain control over both gas distribution and pricing. Regardless of the market structure, LDCs play a crucial role in ensuring that gas reaches end users reliably and safely.

Retail gas suppliers operate within this framework by offering customized contracts, managing customer consumption, and ensuring accurate billing. The complexity of retail gas operations stems from factors such as variable pricing models, seasonal demand fluctuations, pipeline transportation costs, and regulatory compliance requirements. To manage these complexities effectively, retail gas suppliers rely on software solutions like nGenue to automate processes such as price agreement management, meter data processing, and invoice generation.

## Role of LDC

LDC serve as the intermediary between natural gas suppliers and end users, ensuring the safe and efficient transportation of gas from interstate pipelines to residential, commercial, and industrial customers. LDCs own and operate the distribution network, including pipelines, metering stations, and pressure regulation systems, which deliver gas to customers at the required pressure levels.

Each LDC operates under specific regulatory guidelines that define its role in the market, including rate structures, service fees, and safety protocols. In regulated markets, LDCs act as the primary supplier, handling both gas procurement and distribution. In deregulated markets, LDCs manage gas delivery, while customers have the option to purchase gas from competitive retail suppliers.

LDC are responsible for:

* **Establishing rate classes:** LDCs define different rate classes based on customer types (residential, commercial, industrial) and consumption patterns.
* **Managing distribution charges:** These include transportation costs, service fees, and other applicable tariffs.
* **Allocating gas supply:** In deregulated markets, LDCs coordinate with retail gas suppliers to ensure proper gas allocation to customers.
* **Ensuring safety and reliability:** LDCs oversee pipeline maintenance and compliance with federal and state regulations.

nGenue integrates LDC data into its retail gas management system, allowing suppliers to accurately map customer accounts to the appropriate LDCs, apply correct rate structures, and generate invoices based on LDC-specified charges. This integration helps retail gas suppliers optimize pricing, reduce billing errors, and improve customer service.
