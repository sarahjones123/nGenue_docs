# Understanding Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)

**Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)** facilitates the safe, electronic transmission of business data like purchase orders, invoices, and shipping notices among organizations. Through the substitution of paper-based activities with electronic flows, EDI speeds up communication, enhances precision, and guarantees data security.

For **nGenue**, an important role of EDI is to facilitate the specialized business processes and workflows specific to the natural gas industry. It is critical in automating key data transactions among regulators, suppliers, and utilities, minimizing dependence on human labour while improving operational efficiency.

For example, instead of sending a printed invoice by mail, a supplier can transmit an EDI invoice directly into the buyer’s accounting system.

## EDI key benefits

## Key stakeholders involved in EDI transactions

Implementation of EDI in the natural gas sector engages a diverse ecosystem of participants, each playing a vital role in facilitating seamless data exchange. Key players and their functions include:

1. **Distributors**: Natural gas distributors are the chief users of EDI in the natural gas industry. They rely on EDI to:

    * **Transmit purchase orders**: Create and transmit orders electronically to suppliers.
    * **Process invoices**: Receive and manage invoices submitted electronically from suppliers.
    * **Manage meter data**: Obtain, transmit, and receive meter readings with stakeholders, such as the regulator and customers.
    * **Plan and manage supply chains**: Collaborate with procurement suppliers, logistics and distribution companies, and natural gas distributors to procure a consistent and timely supply of natural gas to their customers.

2. **Suppliers**: Suppliers use EDI to communicate with gas utilities and other partners. Their key activities include:

    * **Acknowledge orders**: Confirm receipt and processing of purchase orders.
    * **Send shipping notices**: Provide advance notifications of shipments to utilities.
    * **Submit invoices**: Create and send electronic invoices for goods and services submitted electronically to the gas utility.
